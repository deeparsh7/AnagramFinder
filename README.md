Anagram Finder is a Python script that helps you identify pairs of anagram words within a given list of words. Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## About the Project

This project aims to help you quickly identify pairs of anagram words within a given list of words. It utilizes a Python script that employs an efficient anagram-checking algorithm, based on sorting and set operations, to accurately and rapidly identify anagram pairs.

## Getting Started

To use the Anagram Finder, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Usage

Open the cloned repository in Google Colab or any Python-compatible environment.

Run the anagram_detector.py script.

Follow the on-screen prompts to input a list of words.

The script will then display anagram pairs and non-anagram words from the input list

### Functionality
The Anagram Detector script provides the following functionality:

Accepts a list of words as input from the user.

Identifies anagram pairs within the input list using an efficient algorithm.

Displays the identified anagram pairs and non-anagram words.

Delivers clear and visually organized output, showcasing the identified anagram pairs and non-anagram words in a well-structured manner.

### Results
The script will display the identified anagram pairs and non-anagram words from the input list, providing a clear distinction between the two categories.

### Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of the anagram detection algorithm implemented in this script is O(n^2), where 'n' is the number of words provided. 

The space complexity is O(n), where 'n' is the number of words provided.
 
In terms of efficiency, the space complexity is more efficient compared to the time complexity, as the time complexity grows significantly with the square of the input size, while the space complexity grows linearly.
